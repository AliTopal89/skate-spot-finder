# SkateSpot Finder

## About the App 

I would like to be able to create an app where users have the opportunity to post photos, videos and comments about the spot that they have found

## User Stories
- be able to browse through the dropdown menu of locations
- be able to see the location on a map
- be able to see photos and/or short videos of the spot 
- be able to sign up and post their own photos, vidoes,comments to existing spots or create a new spot 
- be able to rate the the spot, smoothness of the spot, accesibility, human traffic and security
