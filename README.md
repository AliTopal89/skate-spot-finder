# skate-spot-finder

Skateboarding is an art form and for most skateboarders it is the streets. All street skaters have a desire to skate the streets rather than skateparks. There are a lot of places to skate however as they get more popular it brings the attention of others and it becomes difficult for the skaters to enjoy the spots that they like to go to. Therefore, the next best substitute becomes skateparks again. 

This Apps purpose is for skaters all around the world to share new designated spots that they found by posting vidoes photos and their reviews regards to the comfort of the spot, smoothness of the street, accesibility, amount of human traffic and last but not the least security.
