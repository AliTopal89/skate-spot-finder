## Functionality
Meets Expectations. App is deployed on heroku. Function with no major errors being displayed. I encourage you to dive further into your original idea and flesh this app out.

## User Interface
Meets Expectations. UI is relatively intuitive. I would recommend making your text boxes have border. Kind of hard to make out where they are. Polish up the usability of it with regard to CSS. Additionally I would try and figure out how to make the weather underground ajax call more modular in addition to the leaflet markers.

## Maintainability/Code Quality
Meets expectations. Code could be commented better. But naming and indentation are solid. I would recommend seeing how you could integrate more JS. Now that you're learning BB, these things should be a bit easier.

## Evidence of Comprehension
Meets Expectations. Nice job on this project. Seems you have a good grasp on rails. You incorporated user authentication as well as two external APIs. I would definitely like to see more JS however. Going forward, think about how you would integrate more JS in the application itself.
